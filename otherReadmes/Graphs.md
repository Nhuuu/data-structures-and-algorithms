# Graphs
Implement a graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list.

## API
* addNode()
  * Adds a new node to the graph
  * Takes in the value of that node
  * Returns the added node

* addEdge()
  * Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
  * Include the ability to have a “weight”
  * Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
  * Both nodes should already be in the Graph

* getNodes()
  * Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)

* getNeighbors()
  * Returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node
  * Takes in a given node
  * Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection

* size()
  * Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

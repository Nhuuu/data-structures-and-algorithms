# Breadth First Traversal

## Challenge
Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach; print every visited nodeâ€™s value.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- First find the middle point of the sorted array. Check to see if the array at the middle index is equal to the target, if so, return, if the middle point is higher than the target, set the new middle index to be inbetween the old middle index and the end of the sorted array. If the target is lower than the value at the middle index, find the midpoint between the target and the beginning of the array. Do these steps until you find the target. This is O(log n). -->
